      How do Pixel computer glasses work?
   </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-offset-2 col-md-8 faq_para_cont">
     Our glasses filter out the harsh blue light emitted by digital devices such as computers, smartphones, televisions, tablets,
    fluorescent lights, and LEDs. Our lenses allow your eyes to focus easier, reduce eye fatigue and eye strain, and improve
    contrast.

      What is blue light?
   </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-offset-2 col-md-8 faq_para_cont">
     Digital devices such as computers, phones, tablets, and TVs emit large amounts of blue light, the highest energy of all
    visible light (ranging from 400 nm to 500 nm). Blue light regulates our circadian rhythm by effecting the production
    of melatonin in our body. Exposure to great amount of blue light at the wrong time strains our eyes and disrupts our
    sleep cycle.

      Why choose Pixel Eyewear?

<div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-offset-2 col-md-8 faq_para_cont">
     We offer the clearest, most effective lens on the market. Other computer glasses are typically very yellow and have low
    transparency. Our glasses have a very light tint that is not easily noticeable and look just like a normal pair of glasses
    when you're wearing them. Our frames are built with cellulose acetate, the industry standard used by most high-end eyewear
    brands and our selection of vintage and classic styles will keep you looking sharp.
